## 2 Types of governance system

A governance system refers to a set of institutions, or rules, that are used by socio-economic agents to interact with one another. Throughout the analysis we restrict ourselves to the assessment of different exchange mechanisms that represent different systems of governance within the socio-economic space.

We investigate the resulting interaction network that evolves from two different exchange mechanisms:

1. Egalitarian exchange mechanism; and 
2. Cournot-Nash exchange mechanism. 

Both exchange mechanisms are pretty self-explanatory. The egalitarian exchange mechanism allocates resources between all interacting economic agents equally. The Cournot-Nash exchange mechanism simulates a more competitive and efficient economic interaction where demand functions are derived.

Interaction costs are built into the simulations. Note that economic agents can form multiple exchange relationships, but will only engage in some economic interaction if it is mutually beneficial to do so.
