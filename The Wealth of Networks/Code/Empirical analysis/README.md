## About

This directory provides algorithms that correspond to centrality measures discussed in Chapters 5, 6 and 7 of the monograph. In particular, these measures calculate the middleman position, the brokerage, the coverage and criticality of individual and sets of nodes. These measurements are based on game theoretic concepts---such as Strong Nash Equilibrium---which are also contained in the functions. The algorithms are written, and therefore executable, in the R statistical programming language and follow the formulae and mathematics within the monograph.

These directories also contain empirical and synthetic data; some of which is also used within the monograph. This is supplied to allow for testing the centrality measures. 

## Example

Consider the directed network in `testData1.R`. The network contains 7 nodes--one of which is a source and another is a sink---and 8 arcs that can be interpreted as the flow of information, money, or economic goods.
