## About

This repository contains a selection of the data -- and the data-processing scripts -- behind the projects and blog posts at [owensims.co.uk](http://www.owensims.co.uk). Most of these scripts are written in [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/).

I hope you'll use this repository to check my work and to create stories and visualisations of your own. If you do find it useful or want to talk about the work, please [let me know](mailto:sims.owen@gmail.com).
